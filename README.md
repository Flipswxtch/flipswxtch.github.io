This is a walkthrough for a security wargame called Bandit that was created by OverTheWire.org. 
The purpose of OverTheWire.org is to assist people in learning security concepts. A user is forced to learn how to locate passwords 
that are hidden within file systems. Once a password is located, it is then used to access the next level.
